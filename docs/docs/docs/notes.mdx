## Module Support

Commandville supports running CLI packages defined using
[CommonJS module syntax](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html),
[ES module syntax](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/esm.html)
or even TypeScript modules without requring transpilation.

To support [ES modules](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/esm.html)
use the `.mjs` file extension or set the `type` field in `package.json` to `module`.
View [Determining module system](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/packages.html#packages_determining_module_system)
for more information. Node ES modules also
[require using file extensions for relative import specifiers](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_import_specifiers),
e.g., `import {something} from './relative/index.js`. More info on using
[pure ESM packages in node](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

Though commandville supports lifting any module syntax into a CLI, This documentation
uses ES module syntax and assumes either the `.mjs` file extension is being used or
the `type` field in `package.json` has been set to `module`.

## Node Support

Since ES modules are used by the codebase of commandville, Node `^12.20.0` and up is required.

## A Word of Caution

Commandville and all associated packages, `@commandville/*`, are pure ES modules.
This means that CommonJS exports are not provided for these packages and
cannot be `require()`d programmatically. Pure ES modules must be imported
using ES module import syntax. So even though commandville supports running
CLIs defined as CommonJS modules, if that CLI needs to rely on one of the
`@commandville/*` packages programmatically for functionality than that CLI
must be converted to an ESM package. The guide walks through creating a CLI package
as an ESM package. More information on
[pure ES modules in Node](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
